exo_kill = 2
exo_nonkill = exo_kill
exo_nonkill ** exo_kill
print(exo_nonkill)
print("""Some Basic Concepts:

# comments
In PYTHON the code already stars at a new line, so you need to be carefull cuz sometimes you want to have 2 print on the same line.

print("") or even print('')

string = "example1"

print(string)
We can update strings just like C.

string = "example1"
print
string = "example2"
print

Difference between the errors you coul make:

SyntaxError: Something wrong with the way your program is written.

NameError: Occurs when the Code contains a word undefined.

Numbers:

Numeric Data Types in python are automatically refres the type of the number "if its int, float etc..."

Calculations:

The calculations in python are used in a really flexible way, for example:

We can just do it, like print(234 - 30 / 2)

You can just print a number without assigning it to a variable..

Changing Numbers:

It works just like C.. (the same way we change strings value)

Exponents:

We don't need to use the "for" function in python to calcule an exponent, we can use ** instead

Example:

Print(2 ** 4)

Your_mama_pounds = 4 ** 12

Modulo:

Just like C

4 % 3 = 1

Concatenation:

The + operator CAN ADD STRINGS TOGHETERRRRRRRRRR
Example:

message = string1 + string2

Plus Equals:

Shorthad +=, *=, /= (just like c)

Multi-line Strings:

We can use 3" 
Text = 3" random text
